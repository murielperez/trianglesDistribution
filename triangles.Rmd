#Distribution of the Number of Triangles in an Erdös-Rényi RG

There is a nice R package to work with graphs called
[igraph](http://igraph.org/). 

```{r message = FALSE}
library(igraph)
```

igraph is a collection of network analysis tools. It comes with useful
functions to easily generate random $ER(n,p=\frac{\lambda}{n})$ graphs,
plot them, and count the number of triangles, which is what we
need. Let's generate a graph with $n = 100$ $\lambda = 3$,

```{r}
rg <- sample_gnp(n = 100, p = 3/100)
count_triangles(rg)
```
